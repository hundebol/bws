                  <h1>Huge challenge for Blue Water in Singapore</h1>
                  <small>14 january 2015</small>
      <p class="intro">Blue Water Singapore had a huge challenge ahead of them when a jack-up rig, weighing 8,500 metric tons, was required to be towed from Brazil to a shipyard in Indonesia.</p>
 
<p>"Before the float-on operation could commence, the chartered semi-submersible vessel "Xiang Rui Kou", from Chinese operator COSCOL, had to berth at a small shipyard to load six leg sections. The berthing conditions were challenging due to an obstructed quay, but the leg sections were loaded safely on board by a shore based crawler crane that had just enough outreach", says Florian Pinz, Project Chartering Manager from Blue Water Singapore.</p>

<h2>The jack-up rig has arrived</h2>
<p>With the help of three tugs, the jack-up rig was safely floated onto the semi-submersible vessel. As soon as the jack-up rig arrived at Batam Island, Indonesia, it was smoothly discharged under the supervision of Victor Pay from Blue Water Singapore.</p>
